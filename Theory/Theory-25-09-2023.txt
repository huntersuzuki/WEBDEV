HTML 5 elements
===============
1) audio 
2) video 
3) sementic and non-sementic elements.

audio tag: It helps to generate audio player on the browser.
Files format support: mp3,mpeg and ogg

syntax:

<audio controls>
      <source src="audio file relative path" type="audio/mp3">
      <source src="audio file relative path" type="audio/ogg">
      <source src="audio file relative path" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

or

<audio controls src=""></audio>

control attribute: To generate controls such as play button,pause
button and volume bar

Using audio tag with source is advantageous as if any of the 
browser didnt support mp3 and support ogg format for the same 
song then control from mp3 source falls back to ogg format source.
and so on for mpeg format.
So source tag provide fallback if the format is not supported by 
browser.

loop attribute: it is going to play audio agina and again over a time.



video tag 
=========
To embedded video in browser along with its controls video tag is used.

<video controls width="px" height="px" loop autoplay muted>
      <source src="video file relative path" type="video/mp3">
      <source src="video file relative path" type="video/ogg">
      <source src="video file relative path" type="video/mpeg">
</video>


sementic and non sementic elements/tags
======================================
Sementic Tags or elements
--------------------------
The tags or elements that specify their meaning to browser as well as to developer
are called as Sementic Elements.
Sementic tag add importance or significance to the content between tags.
e.g Heading tags h1 to h6, strong,p,emp,table etc are example of sementic tags. 

Non-sementic Tags or elements
----------------------------
The tags or elements that do not specify their meaning to browser as well as to developer
are called as non-Sementic Elements.
They do not add any significance or extra meaning to the content within them.

e.g div,span,b,i etc  

Application of Sementic Tags or advantage of sementic tag over non-sementic tag.
=====================================================
1. SEO Optimization: To increase website ranking
2. Code maintainability

SEO Optimization
================
If two website similar in content, but one webiste encloses all content within
sementic tags and another website encloses all its content within non sementic tags,
Then website with sementic tags had greater chances of getting displyed on the  
first google page as compared to others.
Semetic tags boots ranking of website on google search.


Code maintainability
====================
Any website is generally divide into 3 parts, header, footer and main content.
before introduciton of sementic tags , developer were using following format to 
maintain the code. 

   <div id="header">
           menu bar, images etc 
   </div>

   <div id="main">
       main content of that page.
   </div>

   <div id="footer">
     This contain footer.
   </div>

   The above format was creating a problem for serach engines since it has div tag 
   which is non sementic ,like google to search he content relative to the keyword 
   given by user in search bar.

   so a society W3C i.e World Wide Web Consortium has take a decision to convert 
   this ids into sementic tags.
   <header> <footer> <main> <section> <sidebar> <address> etc.
